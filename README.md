# The JBrowse 2 Plugin List

This repository contains the metadata for the plugins in the JBrowse 2 plugin
store.

## Adding your plugin to the store

We welcome the addition of new plugins to the store! To add your plugin, please
add the necessary data to the end of the `plugins.json` file, and submit a PR to
this repository.

A plugin is described with the following data:

- **name:** the name of the plugin (this should have the same format as what
  should appear in the `config.json`)
- **authors:** an array of the names of the authors of the plugin
- **description:** a short description of the functionality provided by the
  plugin
- **location:** the URL for the repository containing the plugin source code.
- **url:** a URL of where the plugin files are hosted. This enables potential
  users of the plugin to use this URL in their configuration to include the
  plugin in their app. If you publish your package to NPM, a
  [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/) is automatically created for your package. For
  example the URL for the `msaview` plugin is
  `https://unpkg.com/jbrowse-plugin-msaview/dist/jbrowse-plugin-msaview.umd.production.min.js`.
- **license:** the type of software license that your code is provided under. If
  you haven't specified a value, specify `"NONE"`.
- **image (optional):** if you would like an image of your plugin to be
  displayed in the store, please provide an 800 x 200 screenshot of the feature
  you want to show to the img directory. Please provide the download URL for
  that file in your plugin entry. Examples can be found in the existing entries.
